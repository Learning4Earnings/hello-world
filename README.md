# hello-world
creating my first repository
Hi everyone. I am here at GitHub because I see it is a requirement of the Odin Project, which
yesterday I began to research and decided to give it a go. Really have no clue about GitHub and the benefits of it, but I am looking forward to learning.

	My journey in web development and coding can best be described as slow and with many stop & go points. I guess back when I got my first PC back in 1998 my interest in computers began. I would cruise the web and think to myself , hmmm what is going on behind the scenes here? I would think about it but did not do anything about it until nearly ten years later.

	In October of 2007 I had an accident that resulted in several spinal fractures. This injury was going to severely limit my activities for at least 6 months.  I decided what better time to learn more about computer programming. Which, at the time, for me meant learn how to build a web page. Using W3C as my guide, I learned enough about html to construct a home page and link it to several related pages. Wow! This is really cool. Recovered from my injury and back to work and family commitments etc. My web development journey temporarily ended there.

	I tried learning javascript in 2013 and to be honest, I really did not give it a hole hearted attempt. In 2014 I noticed that there was trend in the United States to legalize medicinal and recreational use of marijuana. After talking to one grower he told me that he believed that in the near future there may even be online sales of marijuana. This inspired me to start on a new project which I thought could be potentially profitable and  challenging. So I created a web site geared toward on line sales. Along the way I learned more about html and about the power of CSS to make the web pages more visually appealing. Of course, online marijuana sales has not become a reality. So again my quest in web development waned again.

	Fast forward to 2017. I am still very interested in web development and hope to some day be able to turn that interest into a money making venture. With the advent of many DIY website building
tools like WIX.com and the like, I am thinking that just building a CSS pretty and javascript functional website for small businesses and individuals will pretty much be taken over by these robots. I think that where the real future for developers is on the server side of things. Server side programming is not going to be as readily replaced with robot tools in my opinion. So my quest now is to learn what I can about server side programming. I recently followed some tutorials on php and liked the challenges I faced while learning.
